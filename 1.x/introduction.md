## What is Jetstream?

Laravel Jetstream is a beautifully designed application scaffolding for Laravel. Jetstream provides the perfect starting point for your next Laravel application and includes login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via [Laravel Sanctum](https://github.com/laravel/sanctum), and optional team management.

Jetstream is designed using Tailwind CSS and offers your choice of [Livewire](/1.x/stacks/livewire.html) or [Inertia](/1.x/stacks/interia.html) scaffolding.
